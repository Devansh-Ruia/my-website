        <h1>Welcome to Devansh's Creative (and Occasionally Ridiculous) Space</h1>
        <p>This is where I pretend to be serious but secretly sneak in puns, creativity, and gaming references. Stay tuned!</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>Who Am I? (Besides a Gaming Enthusiast)</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Devansh, an IBDP student who thrives on gaming, playing with my dog, and sleep. If you love programming, games, or the idea of a dog outsmarting me, you're in the right place.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I took the IGCSE program during middle school. My subjects included:
        <ul>
            <li>Physics</li>
            <li>Chemistry</li>
            <li>Biology</li>
            <li>International Mathematics</li>
            <li>ICT (Information and Communication Technology)</li>
            <li>Economics</li>
            <li>French</li>
            <li>English Language</li>
        </ul>
        Fast forward to high school, where I’m now in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP). My subject choices reflect my passion for the sciences, math, and economics:
        <ul>
            <li>Physics HL</li>
            <li>Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL</li>
            <li>Economics HL</li>
            <li>Chemistry SL</li>
            <li>French SL</li>
            <li>English Language and Literature SL</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
    <p>
        Outside the classroom, I keep myself busy with a range of activities:
        <ul>
            <li>CropSense - Created website dedicated to help hobbyist and small farmers. I worked with a team of nine schoolmates</li>
            <li>Model United Nations (MUN) – Chair of the Historical UNSC and active participant since 2021</li>
            <li>Podar Climate Action Club - Senior member</li>
            <li>Monthly Wrap - I created a section dedicated to TOK for IB students and teachers</li>
            <li>Interact Club – Participated and held various projects in rural areas</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Leadership Positions</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout my school years, I’ve held several leadership roles:
        <ul>
            <li>Founder and Fulstack developer (2023 to current day) - CropSense </li>
            <li>Co-chair (2023) – Junior UNSC, Podar MUN</li>
            <li>Chair (2024) – Historical UNSC, Podar MUN</li>
            <li>Head of Communications and Senior Member (2023 to 2025) - Podar Climate Action Club</li>
            <li>Website Manager (2023 to current day) – Monthly Wrap</li>
            <li>Vice President (2022 to 2023) – Interact Club of Garden City</li>
            <li>President (2023 to 2024) – Interact Club of Garden City</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>
        When I’m not drowning in schoolwork, I love exploring topics outside the syllabus. You can often find me reading about technology or world economics. I’m also a dog lover, thanks to Max, my Shih-Tzu, and enjoy sports (with friedns not professionally) and physical activity. Plus, I have a special interest in creative writing and video games!

        <h2>Look at My Work! (No, Seriously, Please Look)</h2>
        <p>
            Here’s where I show off my proudest achievements that will make you go "Wow, that’s impressive" (or at least I hope so):
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics Extended Essay:</strong> Ever wondered how a quantum particle behaves when you mess around with electric fields? My EE dives into this thrilling question: <em>"How does the magnitude of an applied electric field affect the probability density distribution of a quantum particle confined within a double potential well system, while keeping the well separation and well depth constant?"</em> It’s as cool as it sounds—trust me!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Physics IA:</strong> My Physics IA explores how the material bandgap in solar cell design affects electron tunneling efficiency through the energy barrier, while I keep other factors like temperature and light intensity constant. It's a solar-powered journey into quantum mechanics!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Math IA:</strong> I modeled the spread and containment of infectious diseases—because why not use math to stop a pandemic? Whether you're into calculus or epidemiology, this IA has it all.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Chemistry IA:</strong> Ever thought about how solar cells absorb light? My Chemistry IA investigates how the chemical composition of dyes in solar cells can be tweaked to improve absorption efficiency across the solar spectrum. It's bright, colorful, and packed with chemistry goodness!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Economics Macro IA:</strong> What happens when there’s a labor shortage and rising wages in New Zealand? My Economics IA dives into the impact of these challenges on New Zealand’s economy—graphs, numbers, and analysis galore!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Research Paper on Virtual Reality:</strong> In a world where VR might just replace classrooms, I asked the big question: How do virtual reality educational games affect users? Spoiler alert: It’s more than just fun and games—it’s the future of learning.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Model United Nations (MUN) Adventures:</strong> As the chair of the Historical UNSC and a proud MUN nerd, I’ve helped keep world peace (at least in simulated meetings). I’ve also had heated debates about fictional invasions, which is probably more intense than it sounds.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            If you’re still reading, congratulations! You’ve made it through my academic adventures, and no, I don’t just write these things to impress people (though that’s a bonus).

    <section id="blog">
        <h2>Blog (A.K.A. Random Thoughts)</h2>
        <p>If you enjoy deep thoughts interrupted by occasional pop culture metaphors, this blog’s for you. Read on for life’s important questions, like "Is AI Music harmony or disruption?" and "What is the point of Riddler Trophies in Batman Arkham games?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Essay:</strong> Ever tried to write a college application essay that’s both funny and insightful? In mine, I talk about how adopting Max, my Shih-Tzu, transformed my life. Spoiler alert: Max is the real star, not me. From learning empathy to navigating his quirky habits, it’s been a wild ride. You’ll also find a few rhetorical questions and some humor sprinkled in for good measure.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Theory of Knowledge (TOK) Exhibition:</strong> My TOK exhibition was a philosophical journey that featured three objects: an ancient sundial, a Pascal calculator, and an ancient world map (though they weren’t physically available). With limited space—just two school tables joined together—I aimed to show how these objects connected to knowledge and its impact on the world. It was an exciting challenge to engage an audience that wasn’t very familiar with Theory of Knowledge!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Random Musings:</strong> You’ll also find my thoughts on everything from quantum particles and electric fields to why I am bad at Call of Duty Warzone (it’s totally not my fault, I swear).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Stay tuned for more posts where I combine serious topics with a little humor and a dash of creativity!
